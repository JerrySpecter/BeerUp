# Hope you enjoy my work!

When on Beer list page, clicking on heart adds that beer to favorites, clicking on the beer card opens a modal.

on Join Us page, i put two buttons for submiting the form, one that simulates error resposne, and other that simulates success response, both give a visual confirmation plus i left the console.log in there that prints out response object.

When you add a beer to favorites and after that go to Join Us page, when you return the favorites are reset. ;(

Tried to use BEM as much as i can, but in some places i left it withoput BEM because of bootstrap classes im using.
